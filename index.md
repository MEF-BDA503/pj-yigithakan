## Week 3 (Oct 24)

+ Last week I did my homework, but couldn't create a github webpage, now it works!

+ @HW2: I will find a dataset and analyse it on this weekend, I was quite busy with my work lately.

+ @Udacity/R Basics: I watched until "Explore two variables", but I couldn't go through the problem set.

+ @Group Project: I don't have a group yet, if there are some people like me in the class, we can make a group!

## Week 2 (Oct 10)

+ [Here](files/interesting_examples.html) is my 5 interesting R examples.
